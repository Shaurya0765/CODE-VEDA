CODE VEDA PROBLEM STATEMENTS 
Code for Karma – For a Healthier, More Humane Digital World 
Problem Statement: 
In a world increasingly shaped by algorithms and attention-driven design, technology is evolving 
faster than our ability to consciously adapt to it. Social media, recommendation engines, and 
digital platforms often prioritize engagement over well-being, leading to rising concerns about 
digital addiction, declining mental health, and loss of agency. Additionally, users are 
frequently left in the dark about how their data is used, how algorithms make decisions, or how 
to regain control of their digital lives. 
We challenge you to build solutions that promote digital well-being, ethical tech practices, and 
mindful tech use. Can you create systems that make users more aware of their online behavior, 
encourage healthier screen time habits, promote transparency in AI and algorithms, and hold 
digital products accountable for the impact they have? How might we re-engineer the internet to 
work for human flourishing, not just profit and performance metrics?

� Healthcare – Making Quality Healthcare Accessible for All 
Problem Statement: 
Millions of people across the globe still lack access to timely, affordable, and quality healthcare. 
From poor infrastructure and lack of specialists in rural areas to data fragmentation and 
misdiagnosis in urban centers, the challenges in healthcare are vast and varied. Meanwhile, the 
need for solutions that can address mental health, chronic conditions, early detection, elderly 
care, and preventive health continues to grow. 
How can we use technology to bridge this gap? Can you design systems that enable remote 
diagnosis, real-time patient monitoring, or community health awareness? Can tech become a 
frontline responder in underserved areas and a smart assistant in advanced ones?

� AR/VR (Augmented & Virtual Reality) – Designing Immersive Experiences 
with Purpose 
Problem Statement: 
While AR and VR technologies offer immersive storytelling and real-time simulations, their 
real-world applications are still underexplored. What if AR/VR could help doctors train better, 
students learn deeper, or workers operate with more precision? What if virtual environments 
could offer safe spaces for therapy, collaboration, or exposure to inaccessible worlds? 
We invite you to imagine immersive technologies not just as entertainment tools but as engines 
for education, inclusion, training, and social good. How can AR/VR reshape the way we learn, 
heal, connect, and solve real-life problems?

� App Development – Building the Apps That Shape the Future 
Problem Statement: 
Applications are the heart of our digital lives—but not all apps are built equally. The world 
doesn’t need more clones or empty tools. It needs applications that solve real problems, empower 
underserved communities, and enhance everyday life in meaningful ways. 
Can you create an app that brings utility, joy, or equity? Whether it’s for productivity, 
education, finance, accessibility, or local community engagement—your challenge is to design a 
solution that is intuitive, impactful, and responsible. Think big. Think bold. Think useful.

� Sustainable Development – Innovating for a Greener, Fairer Planet 
Problem Statement: 
As climate change accelerates and natural resources dwindle, sustainability is no longer 
optional—it’s urgent. From energy consumption and waste management to food systems and 
urban design, the world faces the challenge of aligning growth with ecological balance. 
Your mission: Build for a sustainable future. Can your solution reduce carbon footprints, 
encourage circular economies, improve conservation, or make eco-friendly habits more 
accessible to the average person? The planet needs problem-solvers. Be one. 
Internet of Things (IoT) – Connecting Devices to Empower People 
Problem Statement: 
From smart homes to connected cities, IoT is revolutionizing how we interact with our 
environments. But there’s still a long way to go in making these systems interoperable, secure, 
and genuinely helpful. Many IoT solutions fail to address privacy, accessibility, or contextual 
intelligence. 
How can we create IoT systems that solve real problems—not just gimmicks? Whether it’s in 
agriculture, health, mobility, or energy—can your solution help us sense better, act smarter, 
and live easier? 
Open Innovation – The Wild Card Track 
Problem Statement: 
Have an idea that doesn’t quite fit into any category? Great. Innovation doesn’t need permission. 
This is your space to think outside the box—whether it’s a tool for creative minds, an AI model 
that learns differently, a civic tech platform, or something no one has imagined yet. 
If you believe your idea can make an impact—build it. Push boundaries. Solve problems that 
others overlook. Or better yet, identify a problem no one has dared to solve. 
✨ Final Note: The Hack Is Open to Your Ideas 
No matter what path you choose—whether you're hacking for impact, ethics, creativity, or fun—
 this is your playground. Think freely. Build courageously. Your idea could be the one that 
sparks real change. 
So go ahead—craft whatever you want.
